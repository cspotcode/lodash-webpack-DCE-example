The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\n * Provide an options object to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on\n * the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent calls\n * to the debounced function return the result of the last `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked\n * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function is\n * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](http://drupalmotion.com/article/debounce-and-throttle-visual-explanation)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false] Specify invoking on the leading\n *  edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait] The maximum time `func` is allowed to be\n *  delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true] Specify invoking on the trailing\n *  edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var args,\n      maxTimeoutId,\n      result,\n      stamp,\n      thisArg,\n      timeoutId,\n      trailingCall,\n      lastCalled = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxWait = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\n  if (isObject(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxWait = 'maxWait' in options && nativeMax(toNumber(options.maxWait) || 0, wait);\n    trailing = 'trailing' in options ?
